# Observables.art

> Observables explores the friction between what we see as reality and what science tells us is fact. A convergence of space and time, the work exists at the intersection of astrophotography, sculpted objects, and interactive immersive environments. Each piece is a study in materiality—the 'rocky' grit of physical existence meeting the 'gassy' translucency of our digital lives. Central to this work is the reality that astronomy is the study of the past: every photon captured is a "light fossil" carrying a history of travel from an era we never inhabited. The installations explore the "shifting shoreline" of the cosmic horizon, demanding a recalibration of our senses to perceive subtle shifts in light, space, and time.
