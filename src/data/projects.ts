    description: 'In the quiet of the gallery, a universe is born and collapses, again and again. Bang is a potent kinetic sculpture that transforms a common scientific instrument—a weather balloon—into a profound and tangible cosmic event. Through a starkly simple yet powerful mechanism, the artwork invites viewers into a direct, physical engagement with the fundamental rhythms of creation and destruction.',
    description2: 'At the heart of the work is a large black weather balloon, whose deep, matte surface is speckled with countless white dots. Using a precisely controlled, closed-loop air pressure system, the artwork performs a relentless, meditative cycle. The balloon slowly expands from a dense, "singularity-like" state to a massive 5.5-foot sphere, holding its form before contracting back to its origin. This rhythmic inflation and deflation is the artwork\'s "cosmic breath"—a living, breathing entity whose presence alters the scale, sound, and even the subtle air currents of the room.\n\nBang powerfully evokes the cycle of cosmic creation and destruction—a tangible metaphor for the Big Bang and the hypothetical "Big Crunch." Its engagement with perception and negative space places it in dialogue with the minimalist and Light and Space movements.',
    description3: 'Like artists who use pigment or light to create seemingly bottomless voids, Bang uses its light-absorbing surface and shifting volume to dematerialize solid form. This work is a distilled, physical expression of Todd Margolis\'s career-long exploration of technology, perception, and immersive experience. While his digital work uses code and screens to transport the user, Bang achieves a similar perceptual shift using only air and latex, giving tangible, rhythmic form to abstract cosmological concepts of universal expansion and contraction.',

    description: 'Spaghettification offers a visceral, firsthand encounter with one of the universe\'s most mind-bending phenomena. The artwork moves beyond mere illustration, crafting an immersive simulation that invites viewers to witness the dramatic distortion of an object as it crosses a black hole\'s event horizon - the infamous "point of no return." Rooted in Einstein\'s theory of general relativity, the piece makes perceptible the theoretical process of extreme tidal forces stretching matter vertically while simultaneously squeezing it horizontally.\n\nThis is not a passive observation, but an embodied experience of overwhelming transformation, designed to evoke the cosmic sublime: a profound sense of awe, fragility, and existential dread. The viewer is confronted with the disintegration of form as an object is elongated into a terrifyingly thin strand, just moments before vanishing into the singularity - the infinitely dense point where the laws of physics break down. Spaghettification thus transposes a purely theoretical concept into a lived sensation, challenging the limits of human perception and offering a confrontation with ultimate unknowability.',
    description2: 'This work is a distilled expression of artist Todd Margolis\'s career at the intersection of art, science, and technology. For over two decades, Margolis has used advanced immersive technologies to visualize complex systems and transform abstract data into tangible, experiential art. His extensive background in Electronic Visualization and pioneering work in Virtual and Augmented Reality provide the robust framework for such a project.\n\nThis piece aligns perfectly with a consistent pattern seen in works like ATLAS in silico, which visualized particle physics simulations in VR, and his research developing "artistically impelled immersive environments for large-scale data exploration." Across his practice - from co-inventing the Varrier™ auto-stereoscopic VR display to leading interdisciplinary teams at institutions like the Qualcomm Institute - Margolis has consistently sought to create platforms that manipulate and extend human perception. Spaghettification is therefore not an outlier, but a signature achievement that leverages deep technological expertise to make the invisible forces of the cosmos palpable, continuing his enduring exploration of the dialogue between scientific inquiry and artistic expression.',

    quote: 'Light is a fossil of time.',
    description: 'Imagine seeing yourself not as you are now, but as you were moments, or even an hour, ago. This series of video mirrors forces a visceral encounter with a profound truth of our universe: because light travels at a finite speed, all observation is an act of looking into the past. By introducing a precise, scientifically-calibrated delay into your reflection, each mirror makes this cosmic latency immediate and deeply personal.',
    description2: 'The work dismantles the illusion of a shared, instantaneous present, rendering the self in the mirror perpetually out of reach—a version of you that has already vanished. The experience scales dramatically, moving from the subtly disorienting to the profoundly estranged. The mirrors cease to be mere surfaces for self-recognition and transform into portals, translating abstract astronomical data into a concrete, lived experience.\n\nThis work is a potent memento mori, a reminder that even in our most immediate self-perception, we are always confronting a ghost. It is the culmination of decades of artistic practice by Todd Margolis, who has consistently explored the intersection of perception, technology, and science. His extensive career in virtual and augmented reality, from co-inventing VR systems at the Electronic Visualization Lab to creating telepresence performances, has always questioned the nature of presence and the delays inherent in mediated communication. This series is a direct extension of that inquiry, grounding the technological manipulation of time not in artistic whim, but in the physical laws of the universe.',

        'In the "Sun" mirror, an 8-minute and 20-second gap separates you from your reflection, translating the immense scale of our solar system into a tangible temporal disjunction. The delay represents the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth, making the vastness of space immediately, personally felt.',
        'The "Saturn" mirror introduces a delay of nearly an hour and a half; the reflected self is so temporally removed it feels like another person, a phantom of your own recent history.'

Using the technique of long-exposure photography, individual stars are drawn out from mere pinpoints of light into mesmerizing streaks and elegant arcs. Each trail meticulously inscribes the path of our own planet’s relentless rotation through space. This is not a picture of stars moving, but rather a direct visualization of the Earth spinning on its axis beneath a fixed firmament. The technique brilliantly compresses hours of cosmic time into a single, silent frame, allowing us to perceive a motion that is otherwise imperceptible. The work offers a profound shift in perspective: we are not passive observers of a distant cosmos, but active participants on a moving world. By rendering the passage of time as a physical trace of light, the series makes the abstract geometry of our planetary existence a tangible, visual experience.',

With a background in Electronic Visualization and a professional trajectory focused on creating immersive systems for large-scale data, Margolis has long used technology to expand the limits of human perception. Whether using a camera shutter left open for hours or designing complex VR environments, the conceptual goal remains the same: to make invisible systems, patterns, and forces both visible and experiential. Just as these images translate the hidden data of planetary mechanics into beautiful form, his advanced scientific visualizations provide new ways to navigate and understand complex information. The "Star Trails" series is therefore more than a collection of stunning astrophotography; it is a rigorous inquiry into reality itself, standing at the intersection of scientific visualization and time-based art, and marking a critical articulation of the technologically-mediated experience that defines Margolis\'s broader practice.'

This custom experience presents seven stereoscopic images of our solar system, crafted initially not from illustration, but from authentic scientific data. By meticulously utilizing parallax data and rotational shifts captured by spacecraft, Margolis transforms raw information from missions like New Horizons and Mars Express into true 3D views of celestial objects.',
    description2: 'Yet, these pristine scientific vistas are not left uninhabited. In a provocative artistic intervention, Margolis disrupts the purity of the data by embedding contemporary avatars of extra-planetary ambition within the scenes. With the simple, mechanical click of the viewer’s lever, one might encounter the icy mountains of Pluto, only to find them scaled by a diminutive Jeff Bezos; turn the wheel again, and Elon Musk is revealed surveying the dust-strewn craters of Mars\'s moon Phobos.\n\nThe result is an intimate, personal encounter with the sublime, complicated by the uncanny presence of human ego. The artwork collapses the immense distances of space, placing both the grandeur of cosmic phenomena—like the explosive energy of a Solar Coronal Mass Ejection—and the caricatures of modern corporate spacefarers directly into your hands. It transforms abstract data into a visceral experience, inviting a private communion with sights otherwise inaccessible to humankind, while simultaneously questioning who gets to claim dominion over them.',

This artwork transforms the incomprehensible magnitude of celestial time into a tangible, visceral encounter.',
    description2: 'The installation functions as a dual-layered cosmic timepiece. Every second, the piece triggers the audible sonification of a unique pulsar—the "cosmic metronomes" of the universe. These spinning neutron stars are the most stable timekeepers in existence, and here, they provide a persistent 1Hz heartbeat for the room. Listeners hear a constantly evolving "chorus of the cosmos," ranging from the sharp, metallic clicks of millisecond pulsars to the hollow, percussive thumps of ancient stars.\n\nThis steady rhythmic immersion is punctuated every hour by a "Catastrophic Event." The pulsar clock falls into a heavy, expectant silence as the room is overtaken by raw, low-frequency data from a LIGO binary black hole merger. By time-stretching these sub-second events into thirty-second swells, METRONOME shifts the experience from the ears to the bones. Using high-output subwoofers, the merger becomes a pressure event—a literal sensation of spacetime being compressed and stretched. It is the sublime rendered audible and tactile for the first time.',

    description: 'This Virtual Reality experience offers a direct, personal encounter with the origins of our universe. You are positioned within a sphere mapped with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)—the faint energy leftover from the Big Bang, often called the oldest light in the universe. Rather than observing data on a screen, you are literally placed inside it. Floating in this primal afterglow, the abstract measurements of cosmology are transformed into an enveloping visual fabric, making the universe\'s birth not just something to be seen, but to be felt.',
    description2: 'This visual immersion is synchronized with a unique audio landscape that represents the Doppler effect, the same phenomenon you hear in the changing pitch of a passing siren. Here, the soundscape gives a visceral dimension to the cosmic motion, expansion, and vast timescales embedded within the light. The experience collapses the immense observational distance between us and the dawn of time, aiming to inspire a state of awe and recalibrate our sense of scale, self, and connection to the grand cosmic narrative. It presents the fundamental story of our universe not as a cognitive exercise, but as a direct, perceptual immersion.',

    description: 'Before you stands a massive, hyper-realistic screen, a digital mirror reflecting the gallery and you within it. But this is no ordinary mirror; it is a window looking down an impossibly deep corridor of time and space. As you watch figures on the screen—your fellow visitors, perhaps even yourself—recede into this virtual distance, a profound transformation begins. First, their image stretches and shifts into the deep, ruby hues of "redshift," the same visual evidence astronomers use to see the universe expanding.',
    description2: 'Further on, they fade beyond visible light, becoming ghostly, high-contrast monochrome figures as if seen in infrared. The most striking effect is that of time itself unraveling. With increasing distance, adults seamlessly de-age into children, then into tiny, near-static newborn infants. This is a direct and poignant visualization of "lookback time," the cosmological principle that to look out across the universe is to look back into its primordial past. At the absolute limit of perception, these infants dissolve completely, fading into the grainy, gray static of the Cosmic Microwave Background—the faint, persistent echo of the Big Bang, the earliest light in our universe. "The 1089th Step" is an immediate, visceral experience that translates the grand, abstract narrative of the cosmos into a tangible and deeply personal journey.',
    description3: 'This work is a powerful culmination of Todd Margolis\'s career, which has consistently pioneered the use of emerging technology to create profound human experiences. His extensive background in developing immersive systems—from inventing new VR hardware to creating "expressive virtual reality contexts" for large-scale scientific data in works like "ATLAS in silico"—provides the technical and conceptual foundation for this piece. "Redshifter" situates itself in the lineage of Light and Space art, but instead of architectural light, it uses sophisticated digital simulation to manipulate our perception. It is not merely an illustration of science but a direct phenomenological inquiry, using the "live feed" to implicate us directly in its cosmic timeline. The installation evokes a modern "technological sublime," harnessing digital media to inspire the same awe and existential reflection that vast natural landscapes once did. By collapsing 13.8 billion years into the length of a gallery hall, the work transforms complex physics into an embodied encounter, bridging the unfathomable scale of the universe with the intimate scale of a single human life and asking a fundamental question: how do we perceive our place within this grand, unfolding story?',

    description: '"Sky Watcher" emerges as a compelling contemporary artifact, a data-driven light sculpture that bridges the vastness of the cosmos with the intimacy of human curiosity. Inspired by the iconic honeycomb geometry of the James Webb Space Telescope, the piece serves as a living infographic for the amateur astronomer. It pulls real-time information from astronomical APIs, analyzing crucial conditions like cloud cover, lunar phase, and atmospheric transparency (how free the sky is from haze) and seeing (how steady the air is). When these elements align for a perfect night of deep-sky imaging, the sculpture awakens. It doesn\'t flash or blare; instead, it projects a soft, vellum-diffused glow, transforming abstract data into an embodied, anticipatory experience.',
    description2: 'This subtle illumination functions as a potent prompt for human perception. The artwork doesn\'t merely present information; it materializes readiness. It fosters a relationship of patience and attunement, training the observer to read the environment through an aesthetic filter, elevating a functional notification into a moment of sublime potential. The eventual act of bringing out the telescope completes a feedback loop, cementing the sculpture as an interface not just between data and light, but between a human desire for cosmic connection and the ephemeral generosity of the heavens. It becomes a living, pulsing index of astronomical serendipity, imbuing a scientific pursuit with ritualistic grace.',
