                  My practice is an ongoing investigation into the imperceptible. By translating data from astronomical observatories into physical forms, I attempt to bridge the gap between the human scale and the cosmic scale.

              <p>
                  With a background in computational physics and sculpture, I use code as a material and light as a structural element. The resulting works are not merely representations of scientific phenomena, but experiential simulations that invite the viewer to question their own position in the universe.
              </p>
              <p>
                  My work has been exhibited internationally and is held in private collections across Europe and North America.
