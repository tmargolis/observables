                  My practice is an ongoing investigation into the imperceptible, bridging the gap between the human and cosmic scale of space and time. With a background in art and technology, I use code as a material and light as a structural element to create experiential immersive environments.

                  Central to this work is the reality that astronomy is the study of the past. Because light travels at a finite speed, every photon captured by a lens is a "light fossil" carrying a history of travel from an era we never inhabited. In my Now and Then series, I explore this "time travel vision" by using AI to generate contextual scenes from Earth’s history—ranging from the prehistoric to the dawn of the Renaissance—matching the exact moment light first departed from a celestial object. By rendering these subjects through the aesthetic of their time, such as stone etchings, flaking parchment, or objects fossilized into rock, I materialize the "latency" of the universe, turning the night sky into a readable archive of human and cosmic heritage.

                  My installations often explore the "shifting shoreline" of the cosmic horizon. The fog wall in The Edge acts as a "curtain of uncertainty" that represent the final wall of sight—the boundary where our vision fails and the uncertainty of our past begins. My work has been exhibited internationally across Europe, North America and Asia.
