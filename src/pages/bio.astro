                  Todd Margolis’s artistic practice bridges the profound gap between the human and the cosmic. His work makes the universe’s most abstract concepts—vast distances and deep time—tangible and deeply personal. For over two decades, he has created artworks that do not just show us images of the cosmos, but instead build new ways for us to perceive our place within it.

                  This practice is rooted in a rare synthesis of artistic vision and pioneering technological development. An alumnus of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s legendary Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), Margolis has spent his career not merely using technology but inventing it—from co-creating VR hardware systems like Varrier™ to serving as Technical Director for major art/science research centers. He treats code as a material and light as a structural element, crafting interactive immersive environments that have been exhibited everywhere from the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago to the National Academy of Sciences. This new body of work is a direct extension of a long-standing investigation into virtual and augmented realities, seen in internationally acclaimed projects like ATLAS in silico and Special Treatment.

                  Central to this work is the reality that astronomy is the study of the past. Because light travels at a finite speed, every photon captured by a lens is a "light fossil," carrying a history from an era we never inhabited. In his <a href="/works/now-and-then/" class="text-indigo-400 hover:text-white transition-colors">Now & Then</a> series, Margolis explores this "time travel vision." Using AI, he generates contextual scenes from Earth's history—from the prehistoric to the dawn of the Renaissance—that match the exact moment light first departed a celestial object. By digitally fabricating these historical styles—rendering subjects as stone etchings, on flaking parchment, or as objects fossilized into rock—he materializes the immense latency of the universe, transforming the night sky from a collection of distant objects into a readable archive of our shared human and cosmic heritage.

                  His large-scale installations extend this inquiry to the very limits of perception. Works like <a href="/works/the-edge/" class="text-indigo-400 hover:text-white transition-colors">The Edge</a> explore the "shifting shoreline" of the cosmic horizon, using elements like a fog wall to create a physical "curtain of uncertainty." This boundary represents the final wall of sight—the point where our vision fails and the unknowability of our own past begins. Ultimately, Margolis's work is a compelling fusion of art, science, and technology. Leveraging deep expertise in AI, data visualization, and virtual reality, he constructs new perceptual shorelines for the viewer—making the imperceptible visible and the incomprehensible intimate, and offering a direct experience of our place within the vast, unfolding narrative of the universe.
