              Observables stakes its territory at the nexus of technological innovation and fundamental phenomenological inquiry, dedicated to intersecting Space & Time. This project re-contextualizes the Cubist fragmentation of form and the Futurist celebration of velocity through a 21st-century lens, incorporating cutting-edge digital and immersive technologies.

              The work seeks to create artifacts from a future we haven't yet reached, presenting not merely objects for contemplation, but experiences designed to induce profound temporal and affective states in the viewer. Encountering these environments, one might feel wonder, disorientation, or even a subtle unease—an experience simultaneously alien and deeply familiar.

              I blend the rocky grit of physical existence with the gassy translucency of our digital lives, appealing directly to sensory paradox. This fusion demands a recalibration of how we perceive materiality in an increasingly dematerialized world, creating a haptic and visual friction that challenges ingrained sensory expectations and fosters deeper, more embodied engagement. The environments, captured in a state of suspended animation, invite viewers into a liminal space where the act of perception becomes an extended, immersive event, rather than a fleeting observation.

              Methodologically, Observables blends astrophotography, sculpted objects, and interactive immersive environments, placing it squarely within contemporary expanded media practices. This approach draws upon the cosmic site-specificity of Land Art, the manipulation of perception found in the Light and Space movement (akin to Turrell or Irwin), and the experiential focus of installation and new media art.

              In an age of accelerated image consumption, the work actively calls to slow down the act of looking and recalibrate our senses. I critically engage with the human tendency to constantly observe yet rarely truly see, aligning with the "slow art" movement and the embrace of contemplative practices. By prioritizing subjective experience and the duration of encounter, Observables confronts and expands the viewer's awareness of their own perceptual apparatus. The work does not simply exist in these intersections of space and time; it actively constructs an experience of them, aiming to profoundly reshape the viewer's very consciousness of reality.
