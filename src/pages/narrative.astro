              My work exists at the intersection of heavy matter and light. By blending astrophotography, 3D-printed planets, and interactive immersive environments, I seek to create objects that feel like artifacts from a future we haven't yet reached.

              Each piece in this collection is a study in texture—the 'rocky' grit of physical existence meeting the 'gassy' translucency of our digital lives. These are not just objects; they are environments captured in a state of suspended animation.

              We are constantly observing, yet rarely seeing. The Observables cycle aims to slow down the act of looking, demanding a recalibration of our senses to perceive the subtle shifts in light, gravity, and time.
