There are several active companies that specialize in creating custom "View-Master" style reels and viewers using your own digital photos. Because the original brand name (View-Master) is a registered trademark of Mattel, most of these services use names like "RetroViewer" or "Custom Reels."


Here are the most popular and reliable services currently active:
1. **Image3D** (RetroViewer)
This is the most well-known service for individual and gift orders.
 * Product: They offer a "RetroViewer" (fully compatible with vintage View-Master reels) and custom reels.
 * Customization: Their website features a "Reel Builder" where you upload 7 photos, add text/captions, and choose a center image for the reel.
 * Turnaround: Typically ships in about 5 business days.
 * Best for: Birthdays, anniversaries, and small personal gifts.
2. **Viewmasterqueen** (3DWorldShop)
Based in the Netherlands but shipping worldwide, this service is highly regarded by enthusiasts for its professional quality.
 * Product: They create high-resolution reels using real film-like quality.
 * Capability: They can handle both 2D photos (showing the same image to both eyes) and true 3D stereoscopic images if you provide the necessary left/right pairs.
 * Best for: High-end collectors, professional photographers, or business marketing.
3. **MyOwnReel**
Another popular European-based service that ships globally.
 * Product: Their viewers often include a focus wheel, which is a great feature for people who wear glasses—something the standard vintage viewers often lacked.
 * Customization: Offers options for express production (48 hours) and various reel colors.
4. **Digital Slides** (UK)
A specialized service in the UK that offers "Retro-View" reels.
 * Product: They focus heavily on the photographic quality of the film.
 * Unique Feature: They offer an AI conversion service that can turn your standard 2D photos into a 3D-effect image for the reel.
5. **Etsy Sellers**
Many individual creators on Etsy act as intermediaries or boutique services. They often bundle custom reels with vintage viewers that have been cleaned or refurbished, which can be a nice touch if you want an authentic "old school" feel.


**Important Things to Know:**
 * 7 Images: Even though you see 14 "windows" on the wheel, you only get 7 total scenes because each eye needs its own window.
 * 2D vs. 3D: Unless you provide specific "stereo" pairs (two photos taken slightly apart), most services will simply put the same photo in both the left and right eye windows. It will look clear and bright, but it won't have the "depth" of a traditional 3D reel.
 * Compatibility: Most modern "custom" reels are designed to be "View-Master compatible," meaning they will work in the original viewers from the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
