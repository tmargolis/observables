This narrative serves as the "copywriting engine" for your site. When you start vibe coding in Cursor, you can feed this document to the AI so it knows exactly what tone to strike and what information to display.

## The Master Narrative: "Observables 2026"

### 1. The Opening Hook (The "Hero" Text)

**Tone:** *Futuristic, Atmospheric, Confident.*

> "A convergence of the tectonic and the ethereal. Observables explores the friction between geological permanence and the fleeting nature of digital atmosphere."

### 2. The Artist Statement (The "Narrative" Section)

**Tone:** *Borrowing from Cargo/Format—Texture-focused and personal.*

> "My work exists at the intersection of heavy matter and light. By blending [Media: e.g., Astrophotography, 3D-printed planets, and interactive/immersive environments], I seek to create objects that feel like artifacts from a future we haven't yet reached.
Each piece in this collection is a study in texture—the 'rocky' grit of physical existence meeting the 'gassy' translucency of our digital lives. These are not just objects; they are environments captured in a state of suspended animation."

### 3. The Curator’s Pitch (The "Private OVR" Text)

**Tone:** *Artlogic Style—Professional, Technical, Exclusive.*

> **[This section is hidden behind your Clerk Login Gate]**
"Welcome to the Viewing Room. This space is designed for institutional preview. Below, you will find the full technical breakdown for the Observables touring cycle.

- **Spatial Concept:** The works are designed to be experienced in a low-light, high-contrast environment.

- **The 3D Walkthrough:** The virtual gallery provides a 1:1 scale simulation of the proposed installation flow.

- **Technical Fidelity:** All works are museum-grade, utilizing [Technical Spec: e.g., low-UV acrylic, archival stone-bonding].

*Inquiry status: Open for 2026/2027 booking.*"

### 4. Technical Metadata (For the "Hover" Effects)

**Tone:** *Minimalist, Archive-style.*

> **Work 01:** [Title] | [Year] | [Dimensions] | [Materials]
**Note:** Requires a 15-amp circuit for integrated lighting. Weight: 45kg.

### 5. Call to Action (The "Inquiry" Button)

**Tone:** *Minimalist HUD.*

> `[INQUIRE // LOGISTICS]`
`[DOWNLOAD BROCHURE .PDF]`

### How to use this in Cursor:

When you open **Cursor's Composer**, use this prompt to start the build:

> "I have my site narrative and aesthetic ready. Please build a minimalist, dark-themed art portfolio.

1. Use **[Opening Hook]** for the hero section with a 'gassy' background animation.

2. Implement the **[Artist Statement]** in a Cargo-style asymmetric layout below the hero.

3. Create a 'Private Access' section using **[Curator’s Pitch]** that only appears once a user is authenticated via Clerk.

4. Use the **[Technical Metadata]** style for a minimalist hover-state on all artwork images.

5. The site must feel rocky, futuristic, and textured."
