Fog makes a good metaphor for the edge of the universe.

Creating a wall of fog (often called a fog curtain or fog screen) indoors requires a specific technique called laminar flow. Unlike a standard fog machine that simply fills a room, a fog wall uses a sandwich of air currents to keep a thin sheet of fog moving in one direction, creating a "screen" that people can walk through or project images onto.

**The "Laminar Flow" Method (Best for a True Wall)**
To make a vertical wall, you need a distribution manifold—typically a PVC pipe or a wooden box—mounted overhead.

- The Manifold: Use a PVC pipe with small holes drilled every inch in a perfectly straight line.

- The Air Sandwich: This is the secret. You need two rows of small fans (like computer fans) on either side of the fog output. These fans create a "curtain" of moving air that prevents the fog from swirling and dispersing, forcing it to fall in a flat, thin sheet.

- The Fog Source: Connect a standard fog machine to one end of the pipe using a flexible dryer hose.

| **Fog Machine**       | Generates the "smoke" using fog fluid (water-based is safest for indoors).                                                                |
| **Fog Chiller**       | (Optional but recommended) Cools the fog so it stays dense and falls faster. You can make one by passing the fog through a bucket of ice. |
| **PVC Pipe/Manifold** | Acts as the "nozzle" for the entire width of your wall.                                                                                   |
| **PC Fans**           | Create the air guides that keep the wall thin and stable.                                                                                 |

**Alternative: The "Geyser" Method (Vertical Jets)**
If you want a wall of fog that shoots up from the ground (like at a concert), use a Geyser Fog Machine.

- These machines are designed to blast fog vertically.

- By lining up 3 or 4 of these in a row, you can create an instant "wall" effect.

- Pro Tip: Use "Quick Dissipating" fluid so the wall disappears almost instantly after the machine stops, preventing the room from becoming too hazy.



**Safety Considerations**

- Slippery Floors: Chilled fog or heavy fog can leave a light residue of moisture on the floor. If people are walking through the wall, place a non-slip mat or towel underneath.

- Smoke Alarms: Standard indoor fog machines will trigger ionisation and photoelectric smoke detectors. Use a "haze" setting or ensure the room is well-ventilated if the alarm system cannot be isolated.

- Airflow: Even a small ceiling fan or AC vent can ruin a fog wall. For the best effect, the air in the room must be as still as possible.
