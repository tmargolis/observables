Astronomers estimate there are approximately **200 billion trillion** ($2 x 10^{23}) stars in the observable universe. This is calculated by multiplying the roughly **2 trillion galaxies** by an average of **100 billion stars** per galaxy.

### The Counting Experiment

We calculated how long it would take a person to count these stars under different conditions:

- **1 Star Per Second:** It would take about **6.3 quadrillion years**. This is roughly **460,000 times longer** than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years).

- **10 Stars Per Second:** Even at this accelerated pace, it would take **634 trillion years**—still about **46,000 times the age of the universe**.

- **The Entire Human Race:** If all 8 billion people on Earth joined in, counting one star per second each, it would still take the collective human race nearly **800,000 years** to finish.

### The Milky Way Perspective

Our home galaxy is a "heavyweight," larger than about **95% of all other galaxies**.

- It contains between **100 billion and 400 billion stars**.

- Counting these at 10 per second would take between **317 and 1,268 years**.
