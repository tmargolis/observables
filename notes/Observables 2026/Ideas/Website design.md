[Exhibition website design ideas](https://g.co/gemini/share/4dd3e3968dd6)

This project overview outlines the strategy for building my personal art website using a **"Neo-Minimalist"** aesthetic.

---

Provide a secure, immersive, and high-fidelity "digital twin" of your exhibition, allowing curators to evaluate scale, narrative, and installation flow remotely.

### 1. The Aesthetic Strategy: "Technical Future-Grit"

We are moving away from the "flat" web and toward a layered, tactile experience.

- **Background:** Deep obsidian (#050505) with a subtle, moving **animated "gaseous" gradient** (indigos and charcoals).

- **Texture:** A pervasive **grain/noise overlay** to give the UI a "rocky" or paper-like grit.

- **Typography:** A high-contrast pairing of **PP Neue Montreal** (clean, modern) for body text and a **Sharp Serif (like Chronicle)** for dramatic headers.

- **Interface:** **Glassmorphism** (frosted-glass) menus and buttons that feel like advanced floating HUDs.

### 2. Site Architecture (The "Curator's Journey")

| Section                 | Content / Feature                                                                                                         | Aesthetic Influence        |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------- |
| **01. The Hero**        | Single high-res image of a "Key Work" + Exhibition Title in kinetic (moving) typography.                                  | **Format** (Clean focus)   |
| **02. The Narrative**   | A scrolling artist statement with "Asymmetric" layouts—text and images overlapping to create a "Zine" feel.               | **Cargo** (Edgy layout)    |
| **03. The 3D Preview**  | **ArtPlacer Virtual Exhibition** embedded as a full-screen window. A button allows the curator to "Enter Walkthrough."    | **Professional Tech**      |
| **04. The Private OVR** | **Clerk-Protected Area.** Once logged in, the curator sees high-res "In-Situ" (mockup) photos, prices, and crating specs. | **Artlogic** (Exclusivity) |
| **05. The Inquiry**     | A minimalist floating button: "Request Technical Rider / Inquire."                                                        | **Modern Gallery**         |

### 3. Technical Stack (2026 Vibe-Coding Build)

- **Development Tool:** **Cursor** (Using the Gemini 3 Pro model for layout design).

- **Hosting:** **GitHub Pages** (Free, fast, and secure).

- **Authentication:** **Clerk** (To manage "Curator-only" access to the Private OVR).

- **3D Engine:** **ArtPlacer** (Embedded via Iframe for the virtual walkthrough).

- **Forms:** **Formspree** (To handle inquiries without needing a backend server).

---

### 4. Curator-Specific Features (The "Secret Sauce")

To separate this from a standard portfolio, we will include:

- **Technical Spec Overlay:** Hovering over a piece reveals its "museum label" (Title, Year, Medium, Weight, Power Requirements).

- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Leveraging ArtPlacer’s widget, allowing a curator to view a piece on *their* gallery walls via their phone.

- **Instant EPK (Electronic Press Kit):** A single-click download of all exhibition assets, high-res photos, and floor plans.

---

### 5. Immediate Next Steps for your "Vibe"

1. **Draft the Narrative:** Write 3 sentences explaining the "Big Idea" of the exhibition.

2. **Asset Prep:** Organize your art into "Public Preview" (standard resolution) and "Curator Detail" (high resolution).

3. **ArtPlacer Setup:** Build the 3D room in ArtPlacer first so we have the code ready to embed.
