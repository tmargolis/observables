[Redshifter](../Ideas/Redshifter.md)


**Concept Overview**
"Redshifter" is an immersive media installation that transforms a physical gallery into a live simulation of the expanding universe. The project utilizes human distance as a direct proxy for cosmological redshift, the phenomenon where the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation increases as it travels through expanding space. Within a gallery space, the laws of astrophysics are compressed onto a human scale, turning every step away from the viewer into a journey through deep time and receding light.



**The Experience**
The installation features an LCD screen acting as a "cosmological portal." As visitors move through the space, a sensor tracks their precise distance (Z-coordinate) and recession velocity. This data is processed in real-time to subject the visitors' images to three fundamental layers of cosmic distortion:

- Biological Lookback: Because light takes time to travel, looking into deep space is equivalent to looking into history. "Redshifter" applies this "lookback time" to guests on a scale where one foot of distance equals two years of biological age. Using GAN-based lifespan synthesis and template-fitting algorithms—similar to the eazy-py tools used by astronomers to model distant spectra—the system digitally de-ages visitors as they move further away. A 50-year-old guest who reaches the 25-foot mark is rendered on-screen as a newborn infant, capturing them at the "beginning" of their personal timeline.

- The Stretching Spectrum: The installation simulates space expanding between the viewer and the guest, stretching the light they emit.

    - Near Range: Guests within the first few feet appear in natural, high-definition color.
    

    - Mid-Range: As they recede, their image smoothly fades into deep, saturated ruby reds, mimicking the shift toward the long-wavelength end of the visible spectrum.
    

    - Far Range: Beyond ten feet, the light is stretched into the invisible infrared spectrum. The system renders these guests in monochrome grayscale, utilizing "false-color" techniques typical of photometric surveys to make the invisible visible.

- Glacial Motion: The expansion of space does not only stretch light; it stretches the very duration of events, a phenomenon known as timescale stretch. In the gallery, guests at the far wall appear to move in extreme slow motion. At the furthest edge, time is dilated by a factor of over 1,000; a single movement that takes one second in the room may take nearly twenty minutes to resolve on the screen.



**The Cosmological Horizon**
The journey culminates at the 23-foot mark, representing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)—the "afterglow" of the Big Bang fireball. This boundary marks the physical limit of the observable universe, where the redshift value reaches. At this point, the "infant" version of the guest ceases to be a distinct figure and dissolves into the grainy, gray cosmic static of the screen, effectively merging with the 3 K radiation that fills the beginning of time.



**References**
The following references provide the scientific, historical, and technical foundations for the Redshifter installation, covering the mechanics of light stretching, the history of expansion, and the computational tools used for age synthesis.Core Scientific Concepts
Redshift (Wikipedia): This source defines the fundamental physics of redshift as an increase in the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, typically characterized by the dimensionless quantity $z$ [1, 2].
Hubble’s Law (Wikipedia): This explains the proportional relationship between the recession velocity of distant galaxies and their distance from Earth, which serves as the physical justification for the installation's spatial scaling [3, 4].
"Light from distant galaxies is stretched..." (BBC Sky at Night): Marcus Chown provides an accessible overview of how the expansion of the universe acts like an inflating balloon to stretch light waves across deep time [5, 6].
Historical Foundations
Key Discoveries (1912–1929): The sources document the work of Vesto Slipher, who first discovered galactic redshifts, and Edwin Hubble, who correlated those shifts with distance to establish the expanding universe paradigm [7-9].
Christian Doppler (1842): These documents track the origin of wave mechanics to Doppler’s initial explanation of frequency shifts in sound and light [10, 11].
The Ives-Stilwell Experiment (1938): This reference confirms the relativistic Doppler effect, proving that motion close to the speed of light causes time dilation that affects observed frequencies [12-14].
Specific Phenomena used in "Redshifter"
Timescale Stretch: Documented in observations of Type Ia supernovae, this phenomenon confirms that the expansion of space stretches the very duration of events, causing distant objects to appear in slow motion [15, 16].
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): This marks the physical limit of the installation at the 23-foot mark, representing a redshift value of approximately 1,089 and the "afterglow" of the early universe [17-19].
The Tired Light Hypothesis: Proposed by Fritz Zwicky in 1929, this alternative (now largely falsified) theory suggests photons lose energy through collisions, a poetic concept used in the installation's "age-regression" narrative [15, 20, 21].
Peculiar Motion: This refers to a galaxy's local movement through space, which the installation simulates using LiDAR velocity data to create temporary Doppler spikes in color [22-24].
Gravitational Redshift (The Einstein Effect): These sources describe how light loses energy when "climbing" out of a gravitational well, a secondary redshift mechanism that informs the installation's ghostly visual distortions [25-28].
Technical and Computational References
"eazy-py" (Yale/Gbrammer): This is the template fitting software and computational neural network program used by astronomers to estimate redshifts from fluxes, serving as the logic for the installation's GAN-based de-aging pipeline [29-31].
Basics of Radio Astronomy (NASA): This tutorial provides the framework for the sonification of light waves, explaining how elongated wavelengths correspond to lower frequencies and lower energies [32, 33].
"A review of redshift..." (Gray & Dunning-Davies): This academic review provides a comprehensive history of the controversy and evolution of redshift interpretations [34].
"Gravitational redshift revisited..." (Fankhauser & Read): This paper clarifies the relationship between equivalence principles, special relativity, and the geometry of spacetime [35, 36].
