A custom View-Master reel containing 7 stereoscopic images:

1. The craters of Phobos (Mars' moon) using the images from the European Space Agency’s **Mars Express** orbiter

2. The icy mountains of Pluto from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft

3. The "heart" feature on Pluto’s surface from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft

4. Proxima Centauri using NASA’s **New Horizons** spacecraft and Earth telescope images from 2020

5. The Sun's Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and solar loops using NASA's STEREO A and B satellites

6. Asteroids using dual observer parallax "Ground-to-Ground" technique

7. The Moon using moonrise and moonset stereo pairs (Diurnal Libration)

Three primary methods to achieve a sense of cosmological depth:
1. **"Pseudo-Stereo" Method**
This is the most common way to create 3D space images for things like custom View-Master reels. Since a nebula doesn't change perspective from our viewpoint, creators manually "extrapolate" the depth.
 * Layering: In software like Photoshop, the stars are separated from the nebula gas.
 * Shifting: The stars are placed on several different layers. To create the right-eye image, the layers are shifted horizontally—stars in the "background" are shifted less, and stars in the "foreground" are shifted more.
 * Result: When viewed through a stereoscope, the brain interprets these offsets as physical depth, placing the nebula "behind" or "inside" a field of stars.
2. **The "Scientific Mapping" Method**
For many nebulae and supernova remnants, we can actually "see" the 3D structure using light.
 * Velocity Mapping: Using spectrometers, astronomers measure the speed of gas. Gas moving toward us is "blueshifted," and gas moving away is "redshifted."
 * Depth Construction: By knowing the speed and direction of the gas, scientists can build a literal 3D computer model of the object. NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory frequently releases these 3D models for objects like Cassiopeia A.
3. **The "Moving Observer" Method**
This only works for objects within or near our Solar System because we can actually change our physical position relative to them.
 * Planets: We can take a photo of Jupiter today and another photo a few hours later when it has rotated. This "rotational parallax" provides two different angles that can be used as a stereo pair.
 * Spacecraft: Probes like New Horizons (Pluto) or Juno (Jupiter) take photos as they fly by. By using two photos taken at different points in the flight path, a perfect 3D stereo pair is created.
 * Earth's Orbit: For nearby stars, we can take one photo in January and another in July. The 186-million-mile diameter of Earth's orbit acts as a massive "stereo base," allowing us to see the star "jump" against the distant background.


How to make your own "Space Reel"
If you want to create a custom reel for a viewer, you can use the Side-by-Side (SBS) method:
 * Find a high-resolution NASA image of a nebula.
 * Use a free tool like StereoPhoto Maker (SPM).
 * Manually create a "depth map" (making the center of the nebula white and the edges black).
 * The software will use this map to "warp" the image into a left and right pair.
 * Upload these pairs to a custom reel service.
