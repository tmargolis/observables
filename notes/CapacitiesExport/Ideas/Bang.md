Bang is a kinetic art installation that transforms a scientific tool into a cosmic metaphor. By using a specialized "breathing" apparatus, the piece serves as a physical representation of the **Big Bang and the expanding universe**, illustrating the tension between a singular, dense origin and the vastness of the resulting void.

### Established Design Decisions

The core aesthetic and material choices are finalized to support this cosmic narrative:

- **Material:** [100g Black Weather Balloon](https://google.com/search?q=100g+Black+Weather+Balloon,+Natural+Latex&prds=headlineOfferDocid%3A7341190351249600050%2Cproductid%3A7341190351249600050%2Cpvo%3A38%2Cpvt%3Ahg&ibp=oshop&igu=1&pvo=38&opi=76091940&gl=us&hl=en&noiga=1). The **natural elasticity** is essential for the metaphor; it allows the "universe" to stretch smoothly from a nearly invisible, dense point to a massive, 5-foot presence, mimicking the fluid expansion of space-time.

- **Aesthetic:** **Solid Black**. This represents the **primordial void**. The deep black surface absorbs light, creating a silhouette that feels like a hole in the gallery space—a "singular point" that grows to consume the viewer’s field of vision.

- **Scale:** The installation cycles between a compact **14-inch "singularity"** and a safe maximum expansion of **5.5 feet**, staying below the burst diameter to represent a universe that is constantly growing but hasn't yet reached its breaking point.

- **Air Logic:** A **closed-loop pneumatic system**. The active vacuuming represents the "Big Crunch" or the theoretical collapse of the universe, creating a perpetual cycle of **creation and destruction**.

### Technical Architecture

The build relies on several specific hardware integrations to manage this "cosmic breath":

- **Air Source:** A **High-Volume Blower** or **Shop-Vac** capable of both high-pressure inflation and active suction.

- **The Interface:** A custom inflation nozzle using [1/2-in PVC Clear Vinyl Tubing](https://google.com/search?q=EZ+FLO+1/2-in+ID+x+10-ft+PVC+Clear+Vinyl+Tubing&prds=catalogid%3A4840720725847025004%2Cgpcid%3A15524435249238155834%2CheadlineOfferDocid%3A8105884925924534085%2Cmid%3A576462859583106928%2Cproductid%3A7330117888288546442%2Cpvo%3A38%2Cpvt%3Ahg&ibp=oshop&igu=1&pvo=38&opi=76091940&gl=us&hl=en&noiga=1) secured with dual industrial zip ties to ensure the "umbilical cord" of the universe remains airtight.

- **The Housing:** A [Norwesco 2" Bulkhead Fitting](https://google.com/search?q=Norwesco+2%22+Double+Threaded+Polypropylene+Bulkhead+Fitting&prds=catalogid%3A6279415437103514731%2Cgpcid%3A9785571743835727871%2CheadlineOfferDocid%3A3720204144015186110%2Cmid%3A576462606099875904%2Cproductid%3A6175093589039828194%2Cpvo%3A38%2Cpvt%3Ahg&ibp=oshop&igu=1&pvo=38&opi=76091940&gl=us&hl=en&noiga=1) provides a professional, airtight passage for the air hose through the base, keeping the mechanical "engine" of the universe hidden from the viewer.

### Remaining Decisions

To finalize the build progress and artist statement, you must still decide on these atmospheric variables:

- **Rhythm:** Should the expansion follow a **mathematical constant** (representing the laws of physics) or an **accelerating rhythm** (mimicking the actual accelerating expansion of the universe)?

- **Sound:** Do you want to **silence the machinery** to emphasize the "silent vacuum" of space, or allow the **industrial roar** to remain as a metaphor for the violent energy released during the Big Bang?

- **Presentation:** Should the balloon be **floor-mounted** (a terrestrial perspective of the cosmos) or **suspended in total darkness** (simulating a celestial body floating in the deep void)?
